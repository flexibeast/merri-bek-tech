Merri-bek Tech provides [web hosting](/docs/what-we-do) for the community of Merri-bek.

We're a fairly new organisation, and we're not operating for profit. We are currently an informal collective, not incorporated. We are run democratically by our [members](/docs/getting-involved/membership/), each of whom has been through at least one [volunteering sprint](/docs/getting-involved/volunteering/).

To find out more, drop us an email at [hello@merri-bek-tech](mailto:hello@merri-bek-tech)
